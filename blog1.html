                    <p class="text-start">Thanks to Munir Virani visiting me during November 2024, reaching from
                        Abu Dhabi. As we talked, I
                        learned about his work
                        (as Chief Executive) at the Raptor Conservation Fund (RCF). Our interesting discussion led me
                        subsequently to delve deep
                        into falconry records for India.
                        The US Blog: What chance to stumble against a blog on Indian falconry done by a US student,
                        Michael Skvarla, at the
                        University of Arkansas. To my utter surprise I found photographs of Dharmakumarsinh ji, a
                        renowned Indian wildlife
                        expert, in Michael’s blog. In one frame, Dharma is holding in his hands a “Lugger” (Laggar
                        falcon: Falco jugger). Frank
                        and John Craighead, two brothers from USA who were his guests at Bhavnagar, held in their hands
                        Saker falcons (Falco
                        cherrug). All three can be seen (in the photo reproduced here) attired in traditional ‘achkan”
                        and “churidaar” royal
                        dresses. (Frank donned Jodhpurs.)
                        Another frame inserted by Michael shows Dharma swinging a lure at the end of a short stick as
                        the male Peregrine falcon
                        (Falco peregrinus), called as tercel, stoops to nibble the bait. After about 40- 50 attempts,
                        the falcon is permitted to
                        strike and bring the lure to the ground. The falcon is then hooded and fed. The photographs are
                        courtesy National
                        Geographic (February 1944) as stated by Michael.
                        Cache of details: Michael states: “It is also interesting to see how historic falconry in India
                        differs from historic
                        and modern falconry in America. For instance, the Craigheads mention catching kites and owls
                        with their birds in India.
                        Other birds of prey were not historically hunted for falconry in America (at least, not that I
                        am aware), and they are
                        protected now. The Indians also employed a classical method of manning in which the bird was
                        carried on the fist for
                        days at a time. Handlers took shifts during the day and night and in this way the birds were
                        tamed in a few days instead
                        of a few weeks as they are with less intensive methods.
                        “Bapa (Dharma) had his trappers catch or buy many species, including peregrines, lugger falcons,
                        sparrow hawks,
                        goshawks, saker falcons, and shahins (shaheen, a subspecies of peregrine). The Craigheads wrote
                        of eagles being trapped
                        but never mention if these were trained for falconry or not. Frank, John, Bapa, and Bapa’s
                        trainers flew all these
                        birds. Game was apparently very abundant as many birds would be cycled through each day.”
                        Dharma as lone expert: Dharmakumarsinh ji (April 1917 – January 1986) was the prince of
                        Bhavnagar State in India’s
                        Gujarat State. He was a great expert on wildlife and probably the only prince who sported
                        falcons and supported falconry
                        in all its disciplines. In 1950, the Government of India appointed him to conduct
                        bio-geographical surveys across the
                        Indian States – Gujarat, Rajasthan and Punjab – and make recommendations on areas suitable for
                        conversion into
                        designated national parks and wildlife sanctuaries. Over the next three decades, he held several
                        conservation-related
                        government positions in India. He served as India's first Honorary Wildlife Warden, Vice
                        Chairman of the Indian Board
                        for Wildlife, and a member of the Rajasthan and Gujarat Wildlife Advisory Boards.
                        My association with Dharma began in 1978-79 when we shared the same table at the Rajasthan State
                        Wildlife Advisory
                        Board. One evening he asked me about the falconry forays in India by Arab royalty using falcons
                        to hunt Bustards. My
                        explanation lured him in to an understanding that culminated in holding first ever International
                        Symposium on Bustards
                        (1, 2 and 3 November 1980 at Jaipur). We spent considerable time in the field as well as in the
                        symposium sessions. I
                        learnt a great deal from Dharma’s ever-giving-away attitudes. Falconry started thousands of
                        years ago though exact
                        records are difficult to find. It gained immense popularity through the Emirs in Middle East
                        during seventh century. The
                        Mughals in India took it to heights. Britain popularized it. The North American Falconers
                        Association (NAFA) was founded
                        in 1961 to encourage it as a sport and enforce the wise use and conservation of birds of prey.
                        NAFA has grown to a
                        membership today of approximately 2,000. It gladly accepts members from all countries who share
                        the common passion of
                        birds of prey and falconry.
                        UNESCO’s decision for falconry: UNESCO has accorded a new global recognition to falconry:
                        “Falconry be treated as a
                        living human heritage (listed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of
                        Humanity of UNESCO).”
                        Is UNESCO’s decision a pointer to India where this practice was in vogue in ancient times, it
                        finds mention in Sanskrit
                        language. Falconry is not a museum piece. It is alive. We should practise, enjoy, and promote it
                        as precious embodiments
                        of world cultural history. Time to start research into the social history of falconry and create
                        better future for birds
                        of prey. Abu Dhabi’s examples are shining for entire world. When we talked, Munir told me that
                        the Raptor Conservation
                        Fund (RCF) was established to develop solutions to key global challenges facing raptors. The
                        Fund was founded by His
                        Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates and Ruler of
                        Abu Dhabi. What utmost
                        satisfaction to know from Munir that nearly 95% Falcon mortalities have been stopped across
                        Mongolia by installing new
                        devices over electric poles in that country! RCF is in action. The RCF’s knowledge and expertise
                        deserves to be
                        introduced in the Thar Desert landscape in India where bird mortalities are on increase from new
                        electric lines drawn
                        following the expansion of solar and wind energy in recent years. The new lines are causing
                        mortality to Great Indian
                        Bustard (Ardeotis nigriceps) as well, the critically endangered species at IUCN. Permit me to
                        touch upon this sorry
                        state of decisions in my next narrative.
                        India’s leadership to take a call: India’s Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, will hopefully be glad
                        to know that a
                        world-renowned falconry expert hails from the Prime Minister’s home State of Gujarat:
                        Dharmakumarsinh ji. Modi has
                        displayed exemplary leadership introducing African Cheetahs in India’s Kuno National Park (17
                        September 2022). A humble
                        appeal is being made to the Prime Minister to let falconry be allowed as a new initiative to
                        enable improve status of
                        raptor species which are facing precarious future. The Abu Dhabi based RCF will be too happy to
                        lend its support as
                        India enjoys excellent rapport with the Emirates in the Gulf region.</p>
